# Coffe_Shop_Sales
This is my first data analyst project, inspired by tutorials I learned from on YouTube, examines a coffee shop's data. Using acquired skills I aim to uncover insights that can enhance business decision-making, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize operational efficiency. This project marks my initial step into the world of data analysis.
